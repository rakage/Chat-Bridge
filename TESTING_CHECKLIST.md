# Widget Dynamic Appearance - Testing Checklist

## Pre-requisites
- Server must be running: `npm run dev` or `node server.js`
- Database must be set up and accessible
- You need a valid company ID in the database

## Test Steps

### 1. Start the Server
```bash
npm run dev
# or
node server.js
```

**Expected Output:**
```
âœ… Socket.IO initialized with enhanced room management
ðŸ“¡ Server running with real-time support
> Ready on http://localhost:3001
```

### 2. Open the Widget Demo Page
- Open your browser to: `http://localhost:3001/widget-demo.html`
- Open browser DevTools Console (F12)

**Expected Console Output:**
```
Widget configuration loaded: {...}
Widget socket connected
âœ… User ${socket.id} joined company:${companyId} room
Joined conversation room: ...
```

### 3. Open Dashboard in Another Tab/Window
- Navigate to: `http://localhost:3001/dashboard/chat-widget`
- Log in if needed

### 4. Make Appearance Changes
Try changing the following settings:

#### Test 1: Primary Color
- Change Primary Color to a bright color (e.g., #ff0000 for red)
- Click "Save Configuration"
- Switch to demo page tab
- **Expected Result:** Widget button color changes immediately to red

#### Test 2: Widget Name
- Change Widget Name to "Support Chat"
- Click "Save Configuration"
- Switch to demo page tab
- Open the widget if not already open
- **Expected Result:** Header title shows "Support Chat" immediately

#### Test 3: Welcome Message
- Change Welcome Message to "Hello! Need help?"
- Click "Save Configuration"
- Switch to demo page tab
- Refresh the demo page (to reset widget)
- Open widget
- **Expected Result:** New welcome message appears

#### Test 4: Position
- Change Position to "bottom-left"
- Click "Save Configuration"
- Switch to demo page tab
- **Expected Result:** Widget moves to bottom-left corner immediately

#### Test 5: Accent Color
- Change Accent Color to #00ff00 (green)
- Click "Save Configuration"
- Switch to demo page tab
- Hover over widget button or send button
- **Expected Result:** Hover color changes to green

### 5. Check Console Messages

**In Demo Page Console:**
```
ðŸ”„ Widget configuration updated, refreshing...
Widget configuration loaded: {...}
âœ… Widget configuration refreshed successfully
```

**In Server Console:**
```
âœ… Emitted widget:config-updated event to company ${companyId}
```

### 6. Test Multiple Widgets
- Open the demo page in multiple browser tabs/windows
- Make configuration changes in dashboard
- **Expected Result:** ALL open widget instances update simultaneously

## Troubleshooting

### Widget doesn't update
1. **Check Socket Connection:**
   - Console should show: `Widget socket connected`
   - If not, check if Socket.io is running

2. **Check Company Room:**
   - Server console should show: `âœ… User ${socket.id} joined company:${companyId} room`
   - Verify companyId matches in widget-demo.html

3. **Check Event Emission:**
   - Server console should show config-updated event when saving
   - If not, verify global.socketIO is available

4. **Refresh Configuration Manually:**
   - In console, run: `window.chatWidgetInstance.refreshConfiguration()`
   - Should see updated config

### Changes persist but don't appear immediately
- Check if widget.js is cached
- Hard refresh the demo page (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Clear browser cache

### Socket.io not connecting
- Verify server is running on correct port
- Check CORS settings in server.js
- Ensure Socket.io client library is loaded in widget-demo.html

## Success Criteria

âœ… Widget appearance changes immediately after saving in dashboard
âœ… No page refresh required on demo page
âœ… Multiple widgets update simultaneously
âœ… Console shows proper event flow
âœ… All appearance properties update in real-time:
   - Colors (primary, accent)
   - Text (widget name, welcome message, placeholder)
   - Position (bottom-right, bottom-left, etc.)
   - Behavior settings (auto-open, delays)

## Additional Testing

### Performance Test
- Open 10+ demo page tabs
- Make configuration change
- **Expected:** All update within 1-2 seconds

### Network Interruption Test
- Disconnect internet while widget is open
- Reconnect
- Make configuration change
- **Expected:** Widget reconnects and receives update

### Browser Compatibility
Test in:
- Chrome/Edge
- Firefox
- Safari
- Mobile browsers

## Notes
- Changes are stored in database, so they persist across server restarts
- Socket.io handles reconnection automatically
- Widget uses both websocket and polling for reliability
