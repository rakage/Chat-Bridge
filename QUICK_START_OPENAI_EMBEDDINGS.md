# ðŸš€ Quick Start: OpenAI Embeddings

Your embedding system has been switched from Gemini to OpenAI!

## 3 Simple Steps to Get Started

### Step 1: Add API Key (2 minutes)

Get your OpenAI API key:
- Go to: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- Create new key
- Copy it

Add to `.env` file:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-your-key-here
```

---

### Step 2: Test It Works (1 minute)

```bash
npm run test:embeddings
```

âœ… Should see: "All tests passed!"

---

### Step 3: Migrate Existing Documents (5-30 minutes)

**If you have existing documents:**

```bash
npm run migrate:embeddings
```

**If you're starting fresh:**

Skip this step! Just start uploading documents.

---

## That's It! ðŸŽ‰

Your app now uses OpenAI text-embedding-3-small:
- âœ… Better quality
- âœ… 60% cheaper
- âœ… Faster processing
- âœ… More dimensions (1536 vs 768)

---

## Cost Example

**Your typical usage:**
- 5,000 documents/year
- ~750 tokens per document
- **Total cost: $0.075/year** (~8 cents)

**Migration cost (one-time):**
- 1,000 existing documents
- **Cost: $0.015** (~2 cents)

## Need Help?

**Full documentation:** See `OPENAI_EMBEDDINGS_SETUP.md`

**Common issues:**

1. **"OPENAI_API_KEY is not set"**
   - Add key to `.env` file

2. **"Invalid API key"**
   - Check key starts with `sk-proj-`
   - Generate new key if needed

3. **Migration is slow**
   - Normal: 3-5 minutes per 1,000 docs
   - Runs in background, safe to continue using app

## What Changed?

### Updated Files:
- âœ… `src/lib/embeddings.ts` - Now uses OpenAI
- âœ… `.env.example` - Added OpenAI documentation
- âœ… `package.json` - Added test/migration scripts

### Created Files:
- âœ… `scripts/test-openai-embeddings.ts` - Test script
- âœ… `scripts/migrate-to-openai-embeddings.ts` - Migration script
- âœ… `OPENAI_EMBEDDINGS_SETUP.md` - Full documentation

### No Changes Needed:
- âœ… All other files work as-is
- âœ… Same API maintained
- âœ… No code changes required
