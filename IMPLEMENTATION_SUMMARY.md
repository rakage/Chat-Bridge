## üß™ Testing Checklist

- [ ] Upload JPEG photo
- [ ] Upload PNG photo
- [ ] Upload WebP photo
- [ ] Try uploading file > 5MB (should fail with error)
- [ ] Try uploading invalid file type (should fail)
- [ ] Remove uploaded photo
- [ ] Upload new photo (verify old one is deleted from R2)
- [ ] Refresh page (photo should persist)
- [ ] Logout and login (photo should still display)
- [ ] Check photo appears in other UI components
- [ ] Test without R2 configured (should show error, not crash)

## üêõ Known Limitations

1. **No image cropping**: Users must crop photos before upload
2. **Single size**: No automatic thumbnail generation
3. **No compression**: Large photos uploaded as-is
4. **Synchronous delete**: Old photos deleted synchronously (could timeout)
5. **No progress indicator**: Upload happens without visual progress

- [ ] Show upload progress bar
- [ ] Add image cropping tool

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Generate multiple thumbnail sizes
- [ ] Add drag-and-drop upload
- [ ] Support for more formats (GIF, SVG)
- [ ] Batch upload for multiple users (admin feature)

### Low Priority
- [ ] AI-powered content moderation
- [ ] Photo gallery (multiple photos per user)
- [ ] Custom photo frames/borders
- [ ] Integration with Gravatar
