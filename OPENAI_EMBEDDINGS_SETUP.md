## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Get OpenAI API Key

1. Go to: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Sign up or log in
3. Click "Create new secret key"
4. Copy the key (starts with `sk-proj-...`)

### Step 2: Add to Environment Variables

Edit your `.env` file:

```bash
# Add this line (replace with your actual key)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-your-key-here
```

### Step 3: Test the Connection

```bash
npm run test:embeddings
```

Expected output:
```
🧪 Testing OpenAI Embeddings (text-embedding-3-small)
✅ OPENAI_API_KEY is set
✅ Success! Dimensions: 1536
✨ All tests passed!
```

### Step 4: Migrate Existing Documents (if any)

If you have existing documents with Gemini embeddings:

```bash
npm run migrate:embeddings
```

This will:
- ✅ Re-generate embeddings for all document chunks
- ✅ Update database with new 1536-dimensional embeddings
- ✅ Show progress and estimated cost
- ✅ Complete in ~20-30 minutes for 1,000 documents

**Cost estimate:**
- 1,000 docs × 750 tokens = 750,000 tokens
- Cost: 750,000 / 1,000,000 × $0.02 = **$0.015** (~2 cents)

---

## Verification

### 1. Check Embeddings are Working

Upload a new document in the dashboard:
- Go to: Training → Upload Document
- Upload any text file
- Check the training logs for "OpenAI" mentions

### 2. Test RAG Search

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/rag/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: your-session-cookie" \
  -d '{"query": "test query", "limit": 5}'
```

### 3. Check Database

```sql
-- Check embedding dimensions
SELECT 
  id, 
  array_length(embedding, 1) as dimensions,
  created_at
FROM document_chunks
LIMIT 5;

-- Should return: dimensions = 1536 (OpenAI)
-- Old Gemini: dimensions = 768
```

## Cost Tracking

### Monitor Your Usage

1. Go to: https://platform.openai.com/usage
2. View daily/monthly usage
3. Set billing alerts (recommended: $5/month max)

### Typical Costs

**Small business (your use case):**
```
- 5,000 documents/year
- ~750 tokens per document
- Total: 3.75M tokens/year
- Cost: $0.075/year (~8 cents)
```

**Medium business:**
```
- 50,000 documents/year
- Total: 37.5M tokens/year
- Cost: $0.75/year
```

**Large business:**
```
- 500,000 documents/year
- Total: 375M tokens/year
- Cost: $7.50/year
```

## Files Modified

### Updated:
1. ✅ `src/lib/embeddings.ts` - Switched to OpenAI API
2. ✅ `.env.example` - Updated API key documentation
3. ✅ `package.json` - Added test and migration scripts

### No changes needed:
- ✅ `src/lib/rag-chatbot.ts` - Uses EmbeddingService (abstraction works)
- ✅ `src/lib/rag-llm.ts` - Uses EmbeddingService
- ✅ `src/app/api/training/train/route.ts` - Uses EmbeddingService
- ✅ All other files importing embeddings

## Migration Details

### What the Migration Does

The `migrate:embeddings` script:

1. **Validates** OpenAI API connection
2. **Fetches** all document chunks from database
3. **Estimates** total cost before starting
4. **Processes** chunks in batches of 50
5. **Updates** database with new embeddings
6. **Shows** progress and statistics

### Progress Output

```
🔄 Starting migration to OpenAI embeddings...
🧪 Testing OpenAI API connection...
✅ OpenAI API working! Embedding dimensions: 1536

📊 Found 1,234 chunks to migrate
💰 Estimated cost: $0.0185 (925,500 tokens)

📦 Processing batch 1/25 (chunks 1-50)
   ✅ Processed 50/1234 chunks
   ⏱️  Elapsed: 12.3s | Rate: 4.1 chunks/sec | ETA: 4.8 min

... (continues) ...

✨ Migration complete! All chunks successfully migrated.

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "OPENAI_API_KEY is not set"

**Solution:** Add your API key to `.env` file

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-your-key-here
```

### Error: "Invalid API key"

**Solution:** 
1. Check key is correct (starts with `sk-proj-`)
2. Verify key is active at https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
3. Generate a new key if needed

### Error: "Rate limit exceeded"

**Solution:**
- OpenAI free tier: 3,000 requests/minute
- Migration script has delays built in
- If still hitting limits, increase delay in script:
  ```typescript
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 500)); // Increase to 500ms
  ```

### Error: "Insufficient quota"

**Solution:**
1. Go to: https://platform.openai.com/account/billing
2. Add payment method
3. Set usage limit
4. Minimum: $5 (more than enough for years)

### Migration is slow

**Normal speeds:**
- ~3-5 chunks/second (CPU bound)
- ~1,000 chunks in 3-5 minutes
- ~10,000 chunks in 30-50 minutes

**If too slow:**
- Check internet connection
- Check server CPU usage
- Increase batch size in migration script

## Next Steps

### 1. Run Tests (Required)

```bash
npm run test:embeddings
```

### 2. Migrate Existing Data (If Applicable)

```bash
npm run migrate:embeddings
```

### 3. Upload New Documents

- Upload a test document
- Verify it processes successfully

### 4. Test RAG System

- Chat with your bot
- Ask questions about your documents
- Verify responses use context correctly

### 5. Monitor Costs

- Check usage at: https://platform.openai.com/usage
- Set billing alerts
- Expected: <$1/month for most use cases

---

## Rollback (If Needed)

If you need to revert to Gemini:

### 1. Restore Old Code

```bash
# Revert embeddings.ts changes
git checkout HEAD -- src/lib/embeddings.ts
```

### 2. Re-run Migration

```bash
# Re-embed with Gemini
npm run migrate:embeddings
```

**Note:** Keep a database backup before migrating!

## Support

### Common Questions

**Q: Do I need to update my code?**
A: No! The API is the same. Just update `.env` and run migration.

**Q: Will old embeddings still work?**
A: No, dimensions changed (768 → 1536). You must re-embed all documents.

**Q: How long does migration take?**
A: ~3-5 minutes per 1,000 documents.

**Q: What if migration fails halfway?**
A: Safe to re-run! Script updates each chunk individually.

**Q: Can I use both Gemini and OpenAI?**
A: No, all embeddings must use the same model (same dimensions).

**Q: Will this affect my chat completions?**
A: No, only embeddings changed. LLM (Gemini/OpenAI) for chat is separate.
