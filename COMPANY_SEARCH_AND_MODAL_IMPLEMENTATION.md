## 🐛 Bug Fixed: Company Search

### **Issue:**
The search functionality in `/setup/company` page was not working:
- Search query was collected but never used to search for companies
- Always showed "No companies found" message
- No API endpoint existed to perform the search
- No loading state during search

### **Solution:**
1. ✅ Created `/api/companies/search` endpoint for searching companies
2. ✅ Implemented debounced search with 300ms delay
3. ✅ Added loading state with spinner
4. ✅ Display search results with company name and member count
5. ✅ Proper error handling

## 🎓 Usage Examples

### **For Developers**

#### Using the Modal in Other Pages
```tsx
import { CompanyModal } from "@/components/company/CompanyModal";

function MyPage() {
  const [showModal, setShowModal] = useState(false);

  return (
    <>
      <Button onClick={() => setShowModal(true)}>
        Setup Company
      </Button>

      <CompanyModal
        open={showModal}
        onOpenChange={setShowModal}
        onSuccess={() => {
          console.log("Company created/joined!");
          // Custom action after success
        }}
      />
    </>
  );
}
```

#### Searching Companies Programmatically
```typescript
const searchCompanies = async (query: string) => {
  const response = await fetch(
    `/api/companies/search?q=${encodeURIComponent(query)}`
  );
  const data = await response.json();
  return data.companies;
};

// Usage
const results = await searchCompanies("acme");
console.log(results); // Array of companies
```

#### Joining a Company Programmatically
```typescript
const joinCompany = async (companyId: string) => {
  const response = await fetch("/api/companies/join", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
    body: JSON.stringify({ companyId }),
  });
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
};

// Usage
await joinCompany("company-id-123");
```
