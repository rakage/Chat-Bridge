---

## 🎯 Implementation

### **File Modified:**
`src/components/dashboard/Header.tsx`

### **Changes Made:**

#### 1. **Imports Added**
```typescript
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";  // Added useEffect
import { Loader2 } from "lucide-react";        // Added Loader2 icon
import { CompanyModal } from "@/components/company/CompanyModal";
```

#### 2. **State Management**
```typescript
const [searchResults, setSearchResults] = useState<Company[]>([]);
const [isSearching, setIsSearching] = useState(false);
const [showCompanyModal, setShowCompanyModal] = useState(false);
```

#### 3. **Real-Time Search with Debounce**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (!searchQuery || searchQuery.length < 2) {
    setSearchResults([]);
    return;
  }

  const timeoutId = setTimeout(async () => {
    setIsSearching(true);
    
    try {
      const response = await fetch(
        `/api/companies/search?q=${encodeURIComponent(searchQuery)}`
      );
      const data = await response.json();
      setSearchResults(data.companies || []);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Search error:", error);
      setSearchResults([]);
    } finally {
      setIsSearching(false);
    }
  }, 300); // 300ms debounce

  return () => clearTimeout(timeoutId);
}, [searchQuery]);
```

#### 4. **Search Results Display**
- Shows loading spinner while searching
- Displays companies with name and member count
- Clickable results that open the modal
- Empty states for no results

#### 5. **Modal Integration**
```typescript
<CompanyModal
  open={showCompanyModal}
  onOpenChange={setShowCompanyModal}
  onSuccess={() => {
    // Refresh page to update company info in header
    window.location.reload();
  }}
/>
```

## 📝 Notes

### **Page Refresh After Success:**
Uses `window.location.reload()` to ensure:
- Header shows updated company name
- Session is fully refreshed
- All components get new company context
- No stale data issues

### **Alternative (No Refresh):**
Could use session `update()` and manual state updates, but refresh is:
- More reliable
- Simpler implementation
- Ensures everything is in sync
- Better for company switches

## 📞 Support

### Common Questions:

**Q: Why does the page refresh after creating/joining?**
A: To ensure the header displays the new company name and all components get the updated session data.

**Q: Can users switch between companies?**
A: Currently, users are assigned to one company. Company switching would require additional logic to handle multi-company membership.

**Q: What if search returns too many results?**
A: Results are limited to 10 companies. Future: Add pagination or more specific search filters.

**Q: Can users leave a company?**
A: Not yet implemented. Future enhancement: Add leave/transfer ownership functionality.
